# Data

Each CSV has data (in a "long" format) from the corresponding phase of training. Columns include the group ("SURPRISE"), the rat ID ("SUBJECT") and the outcome ("Y"). When applicable, these also include the day of training ("Session"), the type of stimulus presented on the corresponding session ("Cue") and the "Baseline" outcome level specific to each rat.
